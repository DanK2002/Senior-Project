# POS+SUM Final Report

## Known Bugs and Issues in Project:
- Super users display for employee list in manage employees.
- Front of House pages do not work without WiFi.
- CSS inconsistencies between managerial pages and order pages.
- Landing page FOH button displays on two lines on certain devices.
- Order Creation does not fully display summary when a new category is selected.  
- Deleting orders using Adjust Price allows for the creation of duplicate order numbers.  

## Incomplete Goals:
- Managers are not able to clock in as a manager on duty when signing in, however, all managers still have managerial abilities.
- Orders are not color coded based on the amount of time passed.

*Some of these incomplete goals are still in progress

## Stretch Goals Completed:
- Time Estimation Adjustments

a) There are a number of ways the time estimation for orders could be tweaked. We will start with a basic system, but may update it if we find better solutions, or add additional features. Perhaps changing estimations based on the day of the week and the time of day.
